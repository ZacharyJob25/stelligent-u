I already accounted for the policy deletion order this with DependsOn. See commit notes. When developing I do not commit change sets to ensure proper init and teardown as a part of the development process. This is why I caught this issue early on. I break my templates down into components so I am not forced to work on top of a tiered app. This is critical for unit testing cloud apps.
